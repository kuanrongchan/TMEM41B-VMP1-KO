# TMEM41B and VMP1 modulate cellular lipid and energy metabolism for facilitating dengue virus infection: Mass spectrometry data
## Heatmap analysis for lipids analysis
1. The raw intensity counts for mass spectrometry can be accessed in the "Lipids_VMP1_TMEM41B_KO.csv" file.
2. The Python analysis file for mass spectrometry can be accessed in the "Lipids_VMP1_TMEM41B_KO.ipynb" file. Data is Z-score transformed using Python codes (command: Z-score = 0)
3. You may open the .ipynb file with Jupyter Notebooks or in Visual Studio Code.
